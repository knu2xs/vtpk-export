# VTPK-Export

Downloading vector tiles from an Esri Vector Tile Service into a Vector Tile Package (`*.vtpk`) to use in creating a Mobile Map Package (`*.mmpk`)  designed for offline use from ArcGIS Pro is nearly impossible. The capability exists on the REST endpoint as the [exportTiles](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/export-tiles-vector-tile-service-.htm) method. This project makes this capability easier to access using Python. 

We'll see how far I get before getting pulled to something else, but for right now, the basic functionality is working and lives in `src/vtpk_export/__init__.py`. If you are able to read a bit of code, understand what it is doing, and use it, please do!
